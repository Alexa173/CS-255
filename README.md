# CS-255

DriverPass was the client. The company wanted to provide an application that serviced student drivers looking to pass their driving test. Their goal was to provide behind-the-wheel instruction to student drivers. 

I think I did the UML class and sequence diagrams very well. I referred to the book many times as I completed both diagrams. 

I would revise the UML activity diagram for DriverPass. I feel as though there were many areas I didn’t cover because of lack of time or possibly over complicating the system. But I would have love to include IT as an actor in the diagram. IT would handle technical issues reported by users. 

To interpret the client’s needs, I make a list of functional and nonfunctional requirements they have expressed. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing the system because it serves as a template for the development team.

The techniques that were used to design the software were creating many UML diagrams to illustrate the functionality of the system. I would use these same techniques in the future when designing a system.
